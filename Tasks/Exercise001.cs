// In this Kata, you will be given an array of numbers in which two numbers occur once and the rest occur only twice. 
// Your task will be to return the sum of the numbers that occur only once.
// For example, repeats([4,5,7,5,4,8]) = 15 because only the numbers 7 and 8 occur once, and their sum is 15.
// More examples in the test cases below.

// Good luck!
